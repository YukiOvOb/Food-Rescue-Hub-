### What is a "Surprise Bag"?
A Surprise Bag is a collection of surplus food from a merchant (like a bakery or restaurant) that is sold at a discounted price. The exact contents depend on what is left over at the end of the day.

### Why is my favorite store not showing any bags?
Merchants only list bags when they have a surplus. If a store has sold out or had no leftovers for the day, they will appear as "Sold Out" or "Nothing Today."

### How do I pay for my food?
All payments are handled securely within the app via credit card, debit card, or integrated mobile wallets. Merchants do not accept cash for app orders.

### Can I choose what goes into my bag?
No. To reduce food waste efficiently, merchants pack whatever items remain unsold. This is why the bags are offered at a significantly lower price than retail.

### How do I collect my order?
Once you purchase a bag through the app, go to the store during the specified "Pickup Window" shown on your digital receipt and show your order confirmation to the staff.

### I missed my pickup window. Can I get a refund?
Orders must be collected during the designated time. If you miss the window, the merchant may no longer be open or the food may have been disposed of, so refunds are generally not provided for missed pickups.

### What if I have food allergies?
Because the contents of Surprise Bags vary daily, we cannot guarantee they will be free of specific allergens. Please check the merchant’s profile for general ingredient information or ask the staff at pickup.

### What should I do if the food quality is poor?
If the food is inedible or does not meet safety standards, please take a photo and contact our support team through the "Help" section in the app within 24 hours.

### Are the merchants verified?
Yes, all merchants on our platform must adhere to local food safety regulations and are vetted by our team before they can list surplus food.

### Can I cancel my order?
You can cancel your order through the app up to 2 hours before the pickup window begins to receive a full refund.
